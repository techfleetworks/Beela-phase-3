            Beela was founded on March 8, 2021 by Juliana Ara√∫jo and Denise Muniz, both Brazilian
            immigrants to Sweden. After meeting at a tech fair, Juliana gave Denise the career
            advice that helped her overcome cultural barriers and land a job in programming. From
            there, they were inspired to empower underrepresented groups to break into tech.
