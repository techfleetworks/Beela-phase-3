## Overview

### Beela

At Beela we are committed to decreasing the evident gap in the unemployment rate between foreign-born women, particularly those from non-European countries, and women and men born in Sweden.

Making a career transition is hard. We help immigrant women and non-binary people define their path, get unblocked, and meet their learning goals. Passion brought us here, and we are empowering the next generation of talented immigrant women and non-binary people.

## How to run the project

<br/>

To run the project in the **development mode**, follow the instructions below:

Download or clone the repository in your computer:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/techfleetworks/Beela-phase-3.git
```

In the repository folder:

- install project dependencies with

```
yarn install
```

- start the development server with

```
yarn dev
```

- open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

To run the project in the **production mode**, use this command instead:

```
yarn build
```
## test your branch locally before making a Pull Request to ensure no errors 
```
use yarn start
```



## how to use sass
<br/>
-create a new terminal. 
-(the first terminal should be bussy with the nextjs server; therefore you need to add a new terminal in which you can write commands in)
 ```
  yarn w-sass
 ```

  -so that SASS can watch the SASS folder and output the results into the CSS folder automatically on every change to a SASS file. 
 this is so that you can always see the changed while in develop mode.
  otherwise changes will only reflect once you restart the next.js server, untill you run yarn dev again.
